# Course Policy
## NSW – No-Show Withdrawal from Online Courses
Students registered in online classes will be issued a no-show withdrawal (NSW) if they do not pursue academic activities within the online environment of the course on at least two separate days prior to the statistical (STAT) reporting day of the class (see No-Show Withdrawals (NSW) & Refunds for information about the NSW refund policy). Academic activities may include, but are not limited to, the completion of assignments, exams and quizzes or participation in online discussions. Academic activities do not include merely logging onto the course site (or learning management system – LMS, see Learning Management System), or acknowledging that you have read the syllabus.
Students who have been issued an NSW by the instructor may, at the request of the instructor, be reinstated (RNS) into the class. See RNS – Reinstate (in a Class) for more information.

## ADW –Administrative Withdrawal
Students are required to attend class. A student may be awarded an administrative withdrawal (ADW) at midterm if the instructor determines that the student is not actively pursuing completion of the course, based upon the instructor’s active pursuit criteria. Active pursuit may be measured by class participation, taking required examinations, quizzes, submission of papers, work assignments, class attendance, etc.
A student in an ONLINE class may be awarded an administrative withdrawal (ADW) between midterm and the last day for student-initiated withdrawal if the instructor determines that the student is not actively pursuing completion of the class, based upon the instructor’s active pursuit criteria. Instructors are required to publish their measures of active pursuit and distribute them to students via their class syllabus during the first week of class. Note: a student who logs into the learning management system or another e-learning platform and engages in no other academic activities is NOT actively pursuing the class. That is, merely logging in to an online course does not constitute active pursuit.
Students who have been issued an ADW by the instructor may, at the request of the instructor, be reinstated (RNS) into the class. 

## Reinstatement:
•	Students may not be reinstated after the last date (available on my.ccc.edu) for student-initiated withdrawals (WTH). 
•	A student who is reinstated (RNS) by the instructor after having received an administrative withdrawal (ADW) may not elect to withdraw (WTH) from the class at a later time.
